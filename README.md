I am a first year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining MIT, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique Majoring in Applied Mathematics and completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) in Lycée Louis-le-Grand.

Working papers
Feature-based PAC learning of minimal representation of an MDP from transition data, with Dessislava Pachamanova, Georgia Perakis, Omar Skali Lami.

Near optimal tractable treshold policies for two-stage robust optimization problems, (Soon to be submitted) with Omar El Housni & Vineet Goyal. (abstract) Winner of Ecole Polytechnique's Grand Prize of research internship.

Research Projects
On random minimal factorizations of large n-cycles (see), with Yassine El Maazouz & Igor Kortchemski.

Complexity of interior-point algorithms: tropical compuations,(see) with Yassine El Maazouz, Stéphane Gaubert & Xavier Allamigeon. This work is the continuity of the following paper.

[Simulating rare events with Hawkes processes](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf). ([see](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/SNA reaserch report.pdf)). Advisors: with Yassine El Maazouz, Emmanuel Gobet & Martin Bompaire.

For highschool students preparing IMO
We founded an organization Math&Maroc with previous International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) contestants to help you train for IMO, visit www.mathemaroc.com for more informations. You can in particular find courses I wrote on the publication section. Here is one of them!

For CPGE students
Here are some courses summaries I made that might help you: [Fiches de cours](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Fiches de cours - Amine Bennouna.7z). You can also find my prépa research report (TIPE) about Prince Rupert's Drop [here](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/La Goutte Du Prince Rupert - Dossier.pdf).
